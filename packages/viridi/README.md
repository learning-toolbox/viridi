# Viridi (WIP)

> A ViteJS plugin to help create your own [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), [Zettelkasten](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes), and/or [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base).

## Introduction

Viridi is a unopinionated, unobtrusive [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) plugin that parses the markdown files (denoted by the `.md` file extension) located in your project and creates a graph of your interconnected notes. One goal is to abstract away the file-system and parsing/analyzing markdown, so that you can focus on pushing forward what tools for thinking, learning, and creating can do! Our other goal is to be unobtrusive to determining how you build your website or web app. If you are curious why we chose to use ViteJS as our dev server & build tool please read [here](#why-vite).

Getting familiar with Vite will be important, but it should be pretty easy to get up and running! We highly recommend reading through the [ViteJS documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Installation

With Yarn

```bash
$ yarn create @vitejs/app

$ cd <project-name>

$ yarn add viridi -D
```

With NPM

```bash
$ npm init @vitejs/app

$ cd <project-name>

$ npm install @viridi -D
```

Add a `vite.config.js` file and add Viridi as a plugin

```js
const { viridiVitePlugin } = require('viridi');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [viridiVitePlugin()],
};
```

## Usage

That's all that it takes to get Viridi setup! The first thing to do is to start adding some markdown files and (ideally) start creating links between them. Read more about how markdown works in Viridi [here](#markdown).

Afterwards, you just import the `@viridi` module to access the graph of your knowledge base in any JavaScript or TypeScript file. Viridi handles importing and parsing your markdown files so that you can easily access and manipulate the underlying knowledge graph.

```ts
import {
  /** List of notes sorted by page rank. Each note contains references to the notes that it links and the notes that link it. */
  notes,
  /** Utility function to get note by its ID */
  getNoteByID,
  /** Utility function to get note by its URL */
  getNoteByURL,
} from '@viridi';

// Use the knowledge graph however you desire!
```

> Fun fact: `@viridi` is not a actual JS in your file system, it is a [virtual file](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#importing-a-virtual-file) that is created on the fly. It seems to be best practice to use the `@` prefix to note this.

### Markdown

We are using `remark` to parse and analyze the markdown files. Here are some things to keep in mind.

#### Frontmatter (WIP)

Viridi lets you define frontmatter for each note that is extracted into the `frontmatter` property on each note.

#### Titles

Viridi extracts the title of a note from the name of the markdown file as opposed to extracting the first `h1` that it encounters in the markdown. This means that most likely don't want to include any `h1` elements in your markdown files. Hopefully it will help remove the duplication of titles and prevent edge cases when trying to parse the markdown. One special case to consider is `index.md`, where the title of the file will become the name of the parent directory. Add a `title` property to the frontmatter to override the title.

### Notes

Each note contains meta-data such as the id, URL, and time of creation. It also contains references to the notes that it references, and the notes that reference it (i.e backlinks). Check out the [client typings](https://github.com/learning-toolbox/viridi/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-viridi/client.d.ts) for more details.

#### Code Splitting

Loading the entire knowledge graph and the content for each note will not scale. Viridi solves this problem by automatically code splitting the content of each note. When needed you can easily request that content. The content of note logs are also code split.

```ts
const note: Note = notes.<id>;
const {content, prompt} = await note.data();
```

#### Page Ranking

[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is an algorithm to determine the important of each node in a graph. Each note has a `ranking` property to help you determine the relative importance of each note. By default, the `notes`, `links` and `backlinks` properties are sorted by page rank.

#### Note Log/History using Git

If your project **uses** `git`, you may be interested in seeing how your notes evolve over time. This opt-in feature will create a log of changes for each note. Viridi will dynamically load the content of the log, when you want it. You have access to the content of the note, links to other notes, and extracted prompts (see [Prompt Extraction](prompt-extraction-wip)). For now we do not extract backlinks to a log because this would require Viridi to recreate the knowledge graph for each commit. ðŸ˜…

#### Link Monitoring (WIP)

Since Viridi created the graph of your notes, we can easily print warnings when notes are orphaned (no other notes link to them) or if there is a link to a note that does not exist.

#### Prompt Extraction (WIP)

This is an opt-in feature that we extract question & answer prompts and cloze-deletion prompts from markdown so that its easy to integrate into embeddable spaced repetition software. Prompts are extracted in the order that they appear.

- Question & answer prompts are removed from the markdown output entirely. Markdown used in the prompt is preserved.
- For cloze-deletion prompts, each paragraph is checked to see if it contains curly brackets (`{` and `}`). If it does then that entire paragraph is considered one prompt and the brackets are removed from the markdown output. Markdown used in the prompt is preserved.

```md
Lorem {ipsum} dolor {sit amet}.

Q: When is _"Lorem Ipsum"_ text used?
A: Its used as a placeholder.
```

```ts
const noteData: NoteData = {
  content: '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>',
  prompts: [
    {
      type: 'cloze',
      content: 'Lorem {ipsum} dolor {sit amet}.',
    },
    {
      type: 'qa',
      question: 'When is *"Lorem Ipsum"* text used?',
      answer: 'Its used as a placeholder.',
    },
  ],
};
```

## Plugin Configuration

There are a couple of options that you might want to configure to enable certain features. Check out the [`UserConfig`](https://github.com/learning-toolbox/viridi/blob/main/packages/viridi/src/core/config.ts#L1) type for more details.

## TypeScript integration

Vite supports using Typescript for the config file. Just call it `vite.config.ts`!

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { viridiVitePlugin } from 'viridi';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [viridiVitePlugin()],
});
```

For client typings please add the following to you `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vite/client", "viridi/client"]
  },
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules"]
}
```

## Examples

Our [playground](https://github.com/learning-toolbox/viridi/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-viridi/playground) is mostly used for testing, but contains a few examples of how to use Viridi!

## Areas of research

- Prefetching links using intersection observer.
- Enabling more powerful bi-directional links.
  - How do you modify an anchor in the rendered markdown?
    - Render `a` by default with note ID, but allow the user to opt in to rendering note links as `span` with the note ID that they can Portal into?
- Better permalinks?
  - [Inspiration](https://twitter.com/jordwalke/status/1350385770234724353)
- Transclusion
  - Still fuzzy what this could look like...
- Search
- Also looking for feedback on what we could do to make it easier to search.
- Incremental builds (i.e. better caching in node_modules)
- Better HMR integration

## Inspiration

A large inspiration for Viridi is the ongoing research/experiments by [Andy Matuschak
](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak), particular [his evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), [Orbit (embeddable SRS)](https://withorbit.com/), and [Note Link Janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor). [Maggie Appleton's](https://twitter.com/Mappletons) writings and ideas (particularly around [Git logs](#git-logs-wip)) has also been very thought provoking.

## Why Vite

For now it's sensible to couple Viridi with a build tool. We evaluated a handful of options and decided that the ViteJS aligned closest with our goals of staying unobtrusive to your pick of web technology and providing you with fantastic DX with little to no configuration to support your workflow. Vite can handle building SPA, SSR, or SSG applications (although the latter two are still experimental at the time of this writing).
